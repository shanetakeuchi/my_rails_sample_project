<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
  The sole purpose of this website is to help me learn
  <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><em>Ruby on Rails</em></a>.
  Since this website is just a learning tool for me, I am not focusing on
  the text that appears on the different pages. My goal is just to create
  the outline of a website that I can use as a refernce for future projects.

<h2>MVC Overview</h2>
<p>
  The model-view-controller architecture is a outline for the interaction
  of a Rails website interacts (among other websites). The basic idea is
  that all interactions with the website move through the controller,
  where they are directed to the view or the model.
